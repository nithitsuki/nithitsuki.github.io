      <description>This is a page I made for the software I use, and think might be useful for others in finding better programs. I&amp;rsquo;m only going to write about programs I have used for a while and tested to be true.
My &amp;lsquo;Philosophy&amp;rsquo; in choosing good software The software must run well on slow hardware with minimal resources, most users over-estimate the amount of power required to complete simple tasks. So, i usually only seek &amp;ldquo;Minimal&amp;rdquo; and efficiently written software with enough features to get the work done.</description>

      <title>Boot from NVMe drive on an unsupported motherboard (UEFI only)</title>

      <description>If your motherboard does not support booting from a PCIe slot, But you&amp;rsquo;ve got one of those &amp;ldquo;nvme to pcie x1 adapter&amp;rdquo; and are surprised that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work
Well, consider yourself lucky! (If your motherboard has UEFI that is)
Since we can use a small workaround to chainload the bootloader/kernel on the pcie slot drive
using a uefi bootloader on another boot drive that is supported (such as a sata hdd).</description>

      <description>When it comes to creating Tech projects, most are created with one of these 2 reasons in mind:
 Out of Passion Out of necessity (school/for your resume/work)  Though I have (as of writing) always started projects out of passion, I have also been interested in making them more useful to me by enhancing my portfolio (resume) or by creating a more marketable product</description>
