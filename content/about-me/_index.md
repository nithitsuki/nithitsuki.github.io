<!-- (That's usually how I start, so get used to it (◡̀_◡́) )  -->
The names Nithil (Nithitsuki is a pseudonym), 18, unemployed (possibly forever) CS & ES student\
I'm currently pursuing a CS degree at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Bangalore\
and a BS degree in ES (Electronic Systems) from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras\
All while trying to balance my Life (gym), hobbies (photography, cooking),\
and my passion for (procrastinating on unfinished) side projects at the same time\
Feel free to take a look around the website as I try to put out as much useful stuff as I can!

Made this website cuz why not lol, I've always loved looking at others interesting and unique personal websites, with everyone sharing their own skillsets, opinions, and just random stuff, not to mention the 88x31 and funny gifs! (probably the only reason that i miss them)
