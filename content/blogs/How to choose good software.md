This is a page I made for the software I use, and think might be useful for others in finding better programs.
I'm only going to write about programs I have used for a while and tested to be true.

# My 'Philosophy' in choosing good software
The software must run well on slow hardware with minimal resources, most users over-estimate the amount of power required to complete simple tasks.
So, i usually only seek "Minimal" and efficiently written software with enough features to get the work done.
If the software is slow to run, even on my main computer, it doesn't get to stay.
also, most importantly, I *ONLY* use [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software#Privacy_and_security) (Free and Open Source Software). No exceptions. Period.

# Basic Software

## Operating System
I currently use [Arch-Linux](https://archlinux.org/) (because of it's up-to-date packages,aur and simplicity)
and [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) (on my super old laptop because it's very slow and needs to be efficient).
(warning: These OS's require somewhat of a beforehand Unix environment knowledge to work with them smoothly. I don't recommend any of these operating system to users without intermediary knowledge in them.)
## Here are the operating systems I've used and think might fit you:
[Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) My parents use it, It's the best OS for those who aren't interested in becoming an Unix-System-Manager for an IT company. It works with other technology out of the box
I recommend it to anyone who asks "What operating system is the_best/should_I_use"
## Shell
I use [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) as a shell, with a slight modification of [Luke smith's .zshrc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/master/.config/zsh/.zshrc) It practically has all of the features of other shells with extra plugins for auto-completion and syntax highlighting.

## Programming
I use [vim](https://www.vim.org/) with some plugins as an IDE and use
1. Shell scripts (for simple automation), and
2. GCC & GDB (for a bit more in-depth programming)

## Other
+ [htop](https://htop.dev/) to easily manage proccess's
+ [tmux](https://tmux.github.io) since 1 tty is never enough
+ [tar,gzip,bzip](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/) to backup/send files 
+ [cups](http://www.cups.org/) to take printouts of documents
+ [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/) to manage files locally and remotely
+ [openssh](https://www.openssh.com/) to connect to other systems


# Utilities

## Documents & E-Books
I use [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/) for pdfs\
[koreader](https://koreader.rocks/) and [vim](https://www.vim.org) for viewing all other documents\
and create/edit them with [groff](https://gnu.org/software/groff/) or [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)\
or [Libre-Office](https://libreoffice.org/) suite for more complex documents\
I also use [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) to manage my eBooks collection.

## Audio
[Vlc](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) & [mpv](https://mpv.io/) to listen to them.\
[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to record audio from my mic.\
[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) To download local mp3 files of my favorite music (if it's not being sold as mp3)
## Images
[sxiv](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Sxiv) to view them.
and [DarkTable](https://www.darktable.org/) since i use a real camera to take pictures.
[krita](https://krita.org/) if i wanted to draw on a screen.

## Videos
Vlc to view them.\
usually ffmpeg to record my screen,\
(or [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) to do more complex screen capture)\
[kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/) if i  ever wanted to edit them

## E-Communication
1. [mutt](http://www.mutt.org/), a minimal email client.
2. [weechat](https://weechat.org/) for irc and xmpp chatrooms.
(use xmpp/matrix/irc/mastodon/Misskey.\ Anything except proprietary software such as whatsapp/telegram/discord)
## Browser
I usually have three browsers:
1. [elinks](http://www.elinks.cz/) when i'm on a tty
2. [netsurf](http://www.netsurf-browser.org/) for my general browsing (it's very fast)
3. [firefox-esr](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/enterprise/) when a website doesn't work on first 2.\
(Note: Firefox usually comes with sub-par default settings, which requires modifiying user.js, about:config, and more hardwork to make it fully private. It is still the best usable browser compared to all other demonic corporation spyware&bloatware browsers such as google-chrome or edge.)
4. [tor](https://www.torproject.org/) to bypass isp/government censorship or dmca-takedowns

## RSS
[newsboat](https://newsboat.org/) if i'm on a tty,\
or [QuiteRSS](https://quiterss.org/) if I have a mouse

## Downloading Clients
1. [cURL](https://curl.se/) for simple urls
2. [qbittorent](https://qbittorrent.org/) for torrents
3. [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for downloading YouTube videos

## Password manager
1. [keepass-xc](https://keepassxc.org/)
